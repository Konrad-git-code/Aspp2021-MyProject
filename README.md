# Aspp2021-MyProject
Repository for the Advanced Scientific Python Programming course project. Details on the project will be updated here. Here I apply certain parts of analysis code that I use in Matlab to Python which involve Gaussian fitting of fluorescent dots in microscopy images. Several scripts are developed for visualising and comparing the fluorescence in the image with the result of the Gaussian fit to evaluate the fit. This is applied to fluorescent dots whose point spread function changes depending on the position of the microscope objective, thus changing the shape of the dot in each image frame. Development and application can be followed in the notebook testing_code_and_plotting.
